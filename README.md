<!-- ## Why? -->


## Usage

You can go <a href="http://3.143.0.66/ ">here</a> to have a chat with IliaBOT!

Currently, IliaBOT will prompt users to get insights on the main features of my resume such as Skills, Work Experience, Projects, and Education right as the users land on the web page, and users are able to go through those sections without having to send a single direct chat message!

There are also some additional things IliaBOT can help users with such as providing a copy of my resume, my contact info, and other features coming soon, but for these features it does not directly prompt users to them right away and they may have to ask for them by sending IliaBOT a chat message.

Hope this helps get some insight on myself and my portfolio, enjoy!
